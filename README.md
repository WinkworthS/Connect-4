# Connect-4
This will be a basic connect 4 game I've been working on this week in my free time.

To play, just download the main.py file and the png image, put them into a folder, and run main.py from there.

By the way, for those who want the icon image, I got it from this link: https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/board-games.
