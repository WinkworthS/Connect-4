# Connect-4
This will be a basic connect 4 game I've been working on this week in my free time.

To play, first you will need to download a package calleed pygame, which you can do by following the instructions from this link: https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted. If you've already got it/done this, then you will need to put the main.py and png files into a folder. All you need to do now is navigate to the directory you created using whatever command line you are using (e.g. command prompt with windows) and running main.py from there (i.e. type in "python main.py").

By the way, for those who want the icon image, I got it from this link: https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/board-games.
