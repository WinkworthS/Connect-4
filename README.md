# Connect-4
<b>Overview</b>
<br>
This is a basic connect 4 game I decided to do for a side-project during my free time this week. I wanted this to be a small project so I have spent less than a week on it.

<b>How To Play</b>
<br>
To play, first you will need to download a package called pygame, which you can do by following the instructions from this <a href="https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted">webpage</a>. If you've already got it/done this, then you will need to put all the files into a folder. Now, you need to  navigate to the directory you created, using whatever command line you are using (e.g. command prompt with windows) and run main.py from there.

<b>Art</b>

I designed the grids.<br>The icon image was from <a href="https://www.flaticon.com/premium-icon/connect-four_3367465">here</a>.
